Repository for bcb420: Computational Systems Biology at the University of Toronto, 2022.

Here are contained files (Rmd and HTML) for selecting, cleaning, and analysing an RNA-seq dataset from the paper "Recurrent Human Papillomavirusâ€“Related Head and Neck Cancer Undergoes Metabolic Reprogramming and Is Driven by Oxidative Phosphorylation". Dataset from GEO. 


The wiki includes notes from lectures, process of doing the assignments, errors, troubleshooting, and mini-assignments like using g:Profiler. 

* Assignment 1: Dataset basics, cleaning, TMM normalisation, sample separation
* Assignment 2: Differential gene expression, multiple-testing correction, and over-representation analysis
* Assignment 3: Non-thresholded geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) and visualize the results using networks (Cytoscape), network annotation.
